# Baybayin Word Images
For Baybayin word recognition systems and other related studies.

## Contents

The dataset has filename `Baybayin Word Images.zip` (attached in release section https://github.com/rbp0803/Baybayin-Word-Images/releases/tag/Baybayin) that contains 1000 Baybayin word images in .PNG format. Each of this image is numbered and named by their Latin equivalent in Tagalog.

The spreadsheet file, `Baybayin Word Images List.xlsx`, contains the list of provided Tagalog words with Baybayin images.

A document file, `Baybayin Word References.docx`, is also uploaded for a list of where I took and snipped most of the Baybayin word images.

This dataset was used to assess our proposed Baybayin word recognition. You can check the full article here.

## Acknowledgments
A big thanks to the Baybayin Facebook Public Group named <b> Baybayin - Philippine National Writing System </b> where I have seen and cropped most of the collected Baybayin word images. The group aims to spread and restore the Baybayin writing system throughout the Filipino Nation and others. You can check their page here https://www.facebook.com/groups/Baybayin.PhilippineNationalWritingSystem. Mabuhay!

## Inspiration
These datasets are part of the ongoing restoration of the Baybayin script in the Philippines. Others may use some of these for Baybayin related researches.
